This project implements a typeahead prediction model that suggests words as a user types to help improve their typing efficiency.  This is akin to products such as [Swiftkey](http://swiftkey.com/en/) which are available for Android and iOS mobile devices.  This was completed as the Project Capstone for the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) offered by [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu/) through Coursera.

### Getting Started

To load your new project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like. For every analysis
you create, we'd recommend putting a separate file in the `src` directory.
If the files start with the two lines mentioned above:

### Notes

This is a sentence that we need to pre-predict.
